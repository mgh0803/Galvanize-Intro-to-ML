# Galvanize-Intro-to-ML
Intro to ML using sklearn datasets

## Class Examples
- These two examples were given within class at Galvanize. 
### Boston_housing
- This example tries to predict the cost of housing in Boston based on factors such as number of rooms, bathrooms, square footage, etc., using linear regression.
### iris_data
- This example looks at data that contains features about the iris. We then try to classify into the correct iris types based on its clustering.

## Additional Examples
- Using and building off the code I learned in class, I looked at other datasets in sklearn.
### Wine_Dataset
- This example looks at wine data and tries to classify the type of wine based on 3 other features. I also built on the Iris example by testing for the optimal number of clusters to use.
### Diabetes_Dataset
- This example uses linear regression to predict the chances of a person having diabetes
### bookpage
- While this example doesn't build directly from the ML courses, we also touched on web scraping in order to use that information for ML. This example scrapes an example site that features books.
